Chess is a classical board game that is played between two players. The game is played on a square chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an eight by eight grid. The objective of the game is to checkmate the opponent’s king by manoeuvring your pieces in a way that prevents their king from moving. There are also several notable ways in which again can end in a draw. At the start of each game, the player controlling the white pieces always moves first. Nowadays, computers running chess engines are significantly stronger than the best human players and the more recent neural network based engines have led to significant developments in the field of chess theory.
